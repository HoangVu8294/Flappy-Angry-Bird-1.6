# Flappy-Angry-Bird-1.6
A Small Game for Android, iOS and Desktop

New update: Flappy Angry Birds 1.6.0.1
--------------------*Update log*--------------------
- Bugs fixing.
- Improve textures blending.
- Reduce times that birds can take hits so that the game is more challenging (Red: 3, Triplets: 3, Chuck: 3, Bomb: 3, Maltilda: 4)
- Triplets' split is more accurate. Can gather as much power as possible. Beginning pipes' vertical gap is increased but shrinks gradually faster.
- Chuck flies increasingly faster when on e (jk, when you hit the power button). Can't gather more power if you got slowed down. When you power up Chuck, dont worry to hit a wood pipe because wood pipes wouldnt do jack squat to Chuck so yea..
- Red on steroid will be Terence who can take 5 hits. And its quite damn big so pretty eye-sighting i should say.
- Cant activate power button when you are obviously powerful. 
- Matilda's eggs cost 1 health/hit rather than pushing you to the matilda's cancer stage.
--------------------*Note*--------------------
- Play the game. Inbox me about bugs pls!! Help a brother out.
- Make sure you guys have JRE to run the game on Desktop.
- I guarantee its free of viruses.
- Enjoy! GL&HF. 
- Pics about bugs would be appreciated.
- Sorry ios fans, still not be able to export it to ipa file and for yall but ill keep working on it. 
*Good morning, its me, Thanksgiving.*
